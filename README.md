### Summary ###
  
- There is about a point difference in 5-star reviews from Vine to non-Vine reviews (40.61% to 45.34%).
- The  lower percentage of 5-star ratings from Vine members compared to non-Vine members, suggests that there is no bias towards high ratings.    
- The number of Vine reviews is quite low, making up 1.07% of the total number of reviews. 
- Of the total number of 5-star ratings reviews, only 0.44% is accounted for by the Vine reviews.
- Within the total sample of reviews, the small proportion (1.07%) of 5-star reviews from Vine members should not likely create a bias.
    
However, for a proper determination of the existence of bias towards high ratings amongst Vine members, more analysis is required:
    
- 5-star ratings amount to 40.61% of the Vine ratings. This relatively high percentage could potentially indicate some bias. 
  A review of the distribution of the Vine ratings does indicate a potential bias towards the higher star-ratings - 5-star & 4-star ratings make up approximately 78% ofall ratings from the Vine members. 
    
This is illustrated below:

- A statistical analysis of the reviews, looking at the mean and standard deviations, provides some more insight into the reviews.

The average rating from Vine members is 4.11 with standard deviation of 0.95.
The average rating from non-Vine members is 3.61 with standard deviation of 1.58.

**This is an indication that the Vine members tend to give higher ratings. So, the reviews indicate that there is a bias towards higher ratings from the Vine members.**
